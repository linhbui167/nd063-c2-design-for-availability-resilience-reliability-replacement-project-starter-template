1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
  Standby instance was already enabled in Multi-AZ configuration so failover to the standby instance can be quickly, about 5 minutes.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
  In this case, we have to promote read replicas and update DNS settings, estimated about 45-60 minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
  According to AWS, transaction logs for RDS is copy every 5 minutes, so RPO for RDS Single-AZ instance failure is typically 5 minutes.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
  Despite the slight increase in latency between regions, asynchronous updates between Multi-AZ, multi-region instances maintain relatively recent data replication. 
  The estimated RPO of around 15 minutes ensures minimal data loss and upholds data integrity across regions, even in the face of regional disruptions.
